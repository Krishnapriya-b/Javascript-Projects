			<dt id="q1"><b>What is ECMAScript?<br></b><br></dt>
				<dd id="a1" class="answer"> ECMA-262 is the international standard that current language implementations (JavaScript™, JScript etc.) are based on.

ECMA-262 defines the language Syntax, Types, Keywords, Operators, and built-in objects. The ECMAScript specification is the reference to determine the expected 
behavior of a program. ECMAScript does not define any host objects, such as document, window, or ActiveXObject.

ECMA-327 defines the Compact Profile of ECMAScript by describing the features from ECMA 262 that may be omitted in some resource-constrained environments. 
http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-327.htm

The most widely supported edition of ECMA-262 is the 3rd edition (1999). There is fair support for this edition in JScript 5.5+ (buggy) and good support 
JavaScript 1.5.

The term "javascript" is used as a common name for all dialects of ECMAScript. </dd>
			<dt id="q2"><b>How do you get a page to perform something only on the initial load, 
			and not when reloaded?<br> Is it done with cookies?<br></b><br></dt>
				<dd id="a2" class="answer">It can be done using cookies, although a lot of people disable cookies. Another alternative is to have a 
				frameset with a hidden frame. 
				You store a variable in the parent frame which says whether the main frame has already been loaded. 
				Each time the main frames loads it checks the parent frame for the variable value to see whether it should perform the once only code: </dd>
			<dt id="q3"><b>Can I access a cookie that is created in a different page than the current page?<br></b><br></dt>
				<dd id="a3" class="answer">Yes. If its in a different directory then you may need to set the path property of the cookie so that it is 
				high enough in the 
				directory tree not to prevent a document in one part of the directory tree from being excluded. For example, if you set the path to:

/topdir/dir1
then files in /topdir/dir2 will not be able to access the cookie. But if you set the path to:

/topdir
Then files in all sub-directories of topdir will have access. By default the path is set to:

/
Which means all files on the server have access to the cookie.</dd>
